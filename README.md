# STAT-3080-Final-Project
This repository is for my final project for STAT 3080: have COVID-19 mitigation measures had an impact on reducing the seasonal flu case and death numbers of the United States 2020-2021 flu season, in comparison to the United States 2019-2020 flu season?

To conduct this analysis, the tidyverse and ggplot2 libraries were used, along with the standard R suite. Both project parts can be downloaded and ran as R markdown files. Both project parts contain the data cleaning steps.

Project Part 1 contains a description of my research question, along with a summary of the data used. The data used can also be found in the attached CSV files. Part 1 also contains both a numerical and a graphical summary of the data used, in order to form some preliminary conclusions on the data.

Project Part 2 contains a short summary of Part 1, along with hypothesis testing. The chosen hypothesis test was also analyzed, to ensure that I could meet the requirements to run it. My final statistical, and general conclusions are also detailed in this part.

My final results, as detailed in part 2, indicated a statististically significant result.
